### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Malin
#### :cherry_blossom: I love problem solving and learning new things :cherry_blossom:
:smiley: Iâ€™m currently on a quest to score my first junior frontend developer role 

:computer: At the moment I'm using the Mimo app to maintain and deepen my knowledge that  
I gained while attending **Technigo frontend developer bootcamp**  

:boom: All my projects so far can be found in my portfolio, please check it out: [Malins Portfolio](https://portfolio-m-skill.netlify.app) :boom:
